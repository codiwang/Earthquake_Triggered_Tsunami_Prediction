# Earthquake_Triggered_Tsunami_Prediction
Binary classification project for predicting whether an earthquake event is associated with a tsunami using machine learning models.

### Environment & Dependencies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:
`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

### How to Run
1. Open "v1_Earthquake_triggered_tsunami_prediction.ipynb" and "v2_Earthquake_triggered_tsunami_prediction.ipynb".
- v1 runs on the whole dataset, this file is only used for comparison with v2
- v2 runs only on data after year 2013 (no historical bias), this is the main file for results generation in the report

2. Upload data file earthquake_data_tsunami.csv to the same directory

3. Run all cells sequentially

4. Review printed metrics and generated plots for model comparison
